# IMPORTANT NOTE
THIS REPOSITORY IS OLD AND OUTDATED!
AFTER UPGRADING OUR CHIP FROM FROM SAMD21 TO SAMD51, WE HAVE MOVED TO A NEW REPOSITORY: [PVDXosV2](https://github.com/BrownSpaceEngineering/PVDXosV2)



# PVDXos
The [outdated repository for the] operating system for Brown Space Engineering's next satellite, PVDX. Currently in the prototyping stage.

**For general instructions on building, deploying, installing the toolchain, or changing ASF config see the [README of bse-fsw-template](https://github.com/BrownSpaceEngineering/bse-fsw-template/blob/master/README.md).**
